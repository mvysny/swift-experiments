# Kotlin Koans in Swift

The [Kotlin Koans](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview), but done in the
[Swift programming language](https://www.swift.org).

This project can be opened in Linux or in MacOS;
in Linux follow [this tutorial](https://mvysny.github.io/swift/).

- To build the project, run `swift build`
- To run all the tests, run `swift test`

All koans are tested in the `KotlinKoansTest.swift` file, using the
older [XCTest framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest).
The reason is that Ubuntu 25.04 only offers Swift 5.10 in the official repositories.
